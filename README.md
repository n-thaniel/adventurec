I have always been interested in low-level languages. At some point I woke up and decided I wanted to play around with C. I learn by doing, not by reading tutorials so I knew I needed a project. 
I discovered Ruud Helderman's ["How to program a text adventure in C"](https://helderman.github.io/htpataic/htpataic01.html) and started following along. 

## Status
At the moment I'm still fumbling around with the basics of C. Most of the code here resembles the state of the guide around Chapter 10.
